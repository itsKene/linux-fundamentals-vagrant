## Project Overview

This repository contains exercises that showcase Linux fundamentals inside a Vagrant-provisioned Ubuntu virtual machine. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with Linux operations in a controlled development environment.

---

## Vagrant Setup

We begin by initializing and provisioning a Vagrant Ubuntu server.

## Exploring Linux File System

We navigate the Linux file system and create a custom folder structure.

**Screenshot #2: Custom Folder Structure**  
_Description: This folder structure `/home/vagrant/projects/devops` was created and populated with list.txt and todo.csv. The pwd can be seen._

## Managing File Permissions and Ownership

We use `chmod` and `chown` to modify file permissions and ownership.

**Screenshot #3: File Permission and Ownership Changes**  
_Description: The file `list.txt` was set to `700` while todo.csv was set to '744'._

## Installing and Configuring a Package

We install a common Linux package (e.g., `nginx`) using `apt`.

**Screenshot #4: Package Installation**  
_Description: `nginx` was installed successfully using 'sudo apt install nginx'`._

## Testing Remote Connectivity

We test network connectivity using the `ping` command.

**Screenshot #5: Ping Test**  
_Description: Pinging `google.com` confirms external network access. The output shows the response time._
